React differs significantly from jQuery and plain JavaScript, particularly in its declarative nature and component-based architecture. Here’s a general overview of common modules and their purposes in a React project:

1. **React**: The main React library, used for creating components and handling the React lifecycle.
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   ```

2. **ReactDOM**: Provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to interact with the DOM or when integrating React with other libraries.
   ```javascript
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   ```

3. **useState, useEffect** (Hooks): These are part of React's Hooks API. `useState` allows you to add React state to function components, and `useEffect` lets you perform side effects in function components.
   ```javascript
   import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   ```

4. **react-router-dom**: Used for declarative routing in web applications.
   ```javascript
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   ```

5. **axios** or **fetch**: Not part of React but commonly used for making HTTP requests.
   ```javascript
   import axios from 'axios';
   ```

6. **styled-components** or **emotion**: CSS-in-JS libraries that allow you to write CSS code within JavaScript.
   ```javascript
   import styled from 'styled-components';
   ```

7. **Redux**: A state management library often used in larger or more complex applications.
   ```javascript
   import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
   ```

These modules enhance React's functionality by providing tools for routing, state management, styling, and more, each serving distinct purposes within a project's architecture.
