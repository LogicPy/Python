Currently only has working audio output, but no audio to text input from mic or audio device... [yet]

Implimenting that soon, current Elie, interacts and slowly learns what you type and what you want...
Elie is a great desktop assistant to have and she's always customized for me! :D

Try her out if you dare..

Talk to her and put on a conversation..

Say hello, and how are you doing? or Perhaps swear at her or call her names! It's all fun with AI..

She can search for anything with keyword search +'miley cryus' or anything!
You can also ask her for output for your pixel location and color of your PC cursor by saying 'pixel color' which she will deliver the data requested quickly and pleasantly. 
You can even type 'mouse coordinates' if you want her to tell you the mouse coordinates.. 

The list of talkable expression goes on the conditional pool of interactions and behaviors..
